### âœ…**Install via Homebrew (Recommended)**

If you don't already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, open **Terminal** and install it:

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Then install PowerShell:

``` bash
brew install --cask powershell 
```

Once installed, run PowerShell using:

``` bash
pwsh
```
